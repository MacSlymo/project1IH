First I imagined the structure of my game.
What is the data I need ? How to store it ?
I thought there would be 3 classes : board, dealer and players (1 or 2).

In the board, the first thing I needed was a deck of cards. I thought first to create manually an array of objects, but then I found on the internet the idea to make a constructor function to generate the deck. Less writings here. I chose this idea.
